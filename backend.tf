# This file configures the remote backend for storing the Terraform state.
# A remote backend is crucial for collaboration and maintaining a reliable state.
#
# NOTE: The actual configuration for the backend will typically be placed 
# within each environment's 'main.tf' or initialized via CLI flags (-backend-config)
# to ensure environment-specific state file paths (e.g., "prod/terraform.tfstate").
#
# Placeholder for conceptual clarity:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "my-tf-state-bucket-12345"
    key     = "common/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "us-east-1"
    encrypt = true
  }
}
